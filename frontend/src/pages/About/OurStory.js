                    <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.</p>
                <br />
                    <p> Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Never let anyone know what you are thinking. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!</p>
